## BREAKOUT BONKERS

A simple Python Breakout game optimized for short, offline play during a 10 to 15-minute commute for that quick “pick-me-up” session from start to end. It is geared towards the casual gamer with short durations of play and emphasis on simple gameplay, immediate startup and shutdown, reliability (no crashes or restarts), and responsive input/feedback throughout the play session.
